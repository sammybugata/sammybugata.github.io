            During this project, I designed an app that helps parents find tutors based on their child’s needs. As the UX/UI designer and researcher, I led the end-to-end process, conducting user and market research, producing journey maps, and translating insights into high-fidelity prototypes using Figma.
            </p>

            <p>
            The final platform balanced strong UX principles, using filters and live tracking to support effective experiences without overwhelming users. The design prioritised personalisation, reduced cognitive load, and ensured that parents could confidently identify programs aligned with their circumstances and preferences.
            </p>

            <strong>Tools and Methods:</strong> Figma, Competitor Research, Usability Testing, User Flows, Low–High Fidelity Prototyping

            <p>
            Tutor booking apps aim to help all kinds of people find and learn from tutors around the world. However, it can be a long process to find the right tutor and commit to a fulfilling journey ahead. For busy and working parents, it's even more important to be able to make a booking within minutes for their children. However, current tutor booking solutions can be confusing, long and do not cater to a lot of parents needs for their children.

                I created a user journey diagram to map the end-to-end experience of parents. Each stage of the flow documented the action, task list, feelings and improvement opportunities. This approach ensured that content, interactions, and decision points were grounded in user needs and reduced cognitive load throughout the process.
                </p>

                <p>
                To better understand how to achieve a simpler and quicker experience, I conducted a competitor audit to experience the problem from a users point of view and recorded complicated areas. I also collected user reviews and noted what users like and dislike to better understand their needs and priorities.

                <p>
                In order to visualise where those features can be implemented in the user journey, I produced a user flow. This detailed the actions the users would take to find relevant tutors and book sessions.

                I made variations of different pages and aimed to include more customizability earlier on in the user journey and easier access to information such as, visibility of the days of the week, tutor qualifications and a chat feature.
                </p>

                <p>
                I evaluated all the wireframe iterations and noted the elements that would better help meet the user's needs and combined those elements into individual pages.

                I explored ways that the app could visually present an easier and faster way to get relevant details. This meant more filter options, better information overviews on the tutor profiles and quick summaries of purchases and bookings.

                Based on the feedback, users still felt that there were plenty of customisation options missing that would help make the filtered results more accurate to their needs. There were pages in the apps where users struggled with the navigation and preferred alternatives.

                After receiving feedback that the user experience could be more intuitive and that certain features such as the search bar, filter options and navigation could have more options for a quicker experience, I began to add more features such as, reoccurring booking options, another filter option based on experience level and improved the layout of the pages.
