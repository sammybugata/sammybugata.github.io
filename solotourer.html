                <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    During this university project, I designed and developed a website that helps female solo travellers connect with others, find local events, get recommendations and learn more about staying safe when travelling in Brazil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the researcher, UX/UI designer and developer, I led the end-to-end development of the platform, from conducting user research, producing site maps, designing Figma prototypes and the development of the platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Research insights were synthesised through thematic analysis and affinity mapping to identify key safety concerns, social barriers, and motivations shaping the experiences of female solo travellers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The final platform balanced accessibility requirements by adhering to WCAG guidelines and was guided by Mike Monteiro’s Designer’s Code of Ethics, ensuring that safety, consent, and user trust were prioritised throughout the experience. The design focused on creating a supportive and transparent environment that empowered users to connect, share knowledge, and make informed decisions while travelling independently.

            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Female solo travelers often face challenges such as, finding reliable information, safety guidance, and like-minded peers while traveling. This makes it harder to feel supported and connected and can lead to a feeling of isolation.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Created a community-driven web platform where users can share experiences, access safety tips, discover events, and connect with other travelers. The platform fosters friendship, knowledge sharing, and confidence, helping solo travelers feel supported throughout their journeys around Brazil.

            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Through thematic analysis and affinity mapping, I synthesised qualitative research into clear patterns, identifying what users value most and where their concerns lie. Clustering insights into themes allowed me to prioritise opportunities and define design directions grounded in real user needs.
                </p>

                <p>Building on these insights, I developed a site map to translate research into structure. The site map clarified core features, defined the platform’s purpose, and ensured each interaction aligned directly with user goals. This step established a strong foundation before moving into wireframing and interface design.</p>

                <p>
                    Mike Monteiro’s Designer’s Code of Ethics informed the design and development of this platform at every stage. Each principle was used as a reflective framework to identify ethical risks, areas for refinement, and potential impacts on user safety, privacy, and trust. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This process guided decisions around data collection, clarifying what information was necessary, how it would be used, and when it could be avoided altogether. Mitigation strategies, such as, minimising personal data, increasing transparency, and prioritising user control were embedded into the design to ensure the platform supported connection and empowerment without compromising user safety.

                <p>
                    Using the site map as a foundation, I developed wireframes in Figma that progressively evolved into a high-fidelity, interactive prototype. This phase focused on translating research insights into clear, usable interface structures that supported safety, clarity, and community engagement.

            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Initial designs focused on six core pages:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Emergency Response</li>
                    <li>Guides</li>
                    <li>Community</li>
                    <li>Events</li>
                    <li>Contact</li>
                    <li>About Us</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Through iterative refinement, these evolved into:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Home</li>
                    <li>Safety Guides</li>
                    <li>Events</li>
                    <li>Community</li>
                    <li>Insights & Recommendations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This restructuring ensured each page provided a clear overview of its content while surfacing only the most relevant information, reducing clutter and improving overall usability.</p>


                <P>
                    The platform was built as a community-focused website. Iterative testing with target users informed refinements to ensure the experience felt safe, engaging, and supportive.
