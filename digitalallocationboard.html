            A digital allocation board that enables shift coordinators to assign operating room staff to theatres based on daily case lists, and dynamically reallocate them for meal relief or setup support. The tool provides real-time visibility of theatre status and supports efficient management of last-minute staffing changes.

            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
            <p>
            During this university to industry project, I designed and developed a digital allocation platform to improve the shift allocation experience for both coordinators and nurses. As the UX/UI designer and front-end developer, I led the end-to-end process for the design and development of the shift coordinator’s experience, spanning user research, information architecture, and front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
            The final website balanced strong UX principles with essential information delivery, featuring a responsive design and user-tested interactions that supported efficiency, reduced cognitive load, and fewer errors.

            <div class="section-content">
            <p>
            A hospital currently relies on a paper forms to keep track of operating theatres. This makes it hard to update staff of changes and limits access, causing poor communication and inefficiency between surgery teams.

                    A responsive digital allocation system that streamlines theatre scheduling, enables real-time updates, and ensures all staff stay aligned through clear, accessible, and up-to-date information.

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                I conducted interviews and workflow walkthroughs with a scrub nurse who had firsthand experience with the current allocation process. Throughout the project, I iterated on prototypes with her to understand how well each version supported her tasks, information needs, and pace of work. Her ongoing feedback highlighted where the design aligned with real theatre workflows and where it still needed improvement, allowing me to refine the interface and interactions to better meet the demands of a fast-paced clinical environment.
                </p>

                <p>To establish a clear structure, I designed a sitemap that clearly defined the information architecture to ensure intuitive navigation and logical content flow.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Using Figma, I translated the information architecture into wireframes, creating both low- and high-fidelity versions to map the user flow and to refine interactions, navigation flows and layouts through iterative testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The initial design of the shift coordinator user flow featured three pages: the dashboard, requests and schedule. Initial feedback in the first cycle inspired further exploration for the schedule for assignment and overview of theatres. The next iterations explores it with a list view of the meal relief staff so coordinators can see an overview of the different kinds of staff they are in charge of assigning.

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    This project deepened my understanding of designing for high-stakes, operational healthcare environments where clarity and reliability matter just as much as aesthetics. I learned how important it is to create systems that support rapid decision-making, integrate smoothly into existing workflows, and remain flexible in the face of constant change. I also gained valuable experience balancing the needs of multiple user groups including coordinators, nurses, and orderlies, and designing tools that help teams stay aligned, informed, and confident throughout their workday.
