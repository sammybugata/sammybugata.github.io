            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                During this industry project, I designed a platform that helps carers and patients find patient support programs based on their medical needs. As the sole UX/UI designer and researcher in the company, I led the end-to-end process, from conducting a literature review to creating an interactive prototype of the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final platform balanced strong UX principles with essential information delivery, using guided questions and metadata-driven filtering to support efficient discovery. The design prioritised personalisation, reduced cognitive load, and ensured that patients and carers could quickly identify programs aligned with their conditions, preferences, and circumstances.

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    Patients and caregivers often struggle to find relevant support programs that match their unique needs. Existing resources are scattered and generic, making it difficult to identify programs that truly fit their situation.

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                The research phase included a literature review to consolidate existing solutions and the issues that users currently face which influenced the development of a user journey to map the end-to-end experience of patients and carers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each stage of the flow documented the information presented to users, the purpose of that step, and the inputs required to progress. This approach ensured that content, interactions, and decision points were grounded in user needs, supported progressive disclosure, and reduced cognitive load throughout the discovery process.

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    The ideation and development phase involved the creation of low-fidelity prototypes, which were evaluated in collaboration with the company’s engineer and founder (a doctor). Their feedback informed iterative refinements, ensuring the designs were technically feasible and clinically appropriate.

                <h3>THE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                    The platform included onboarding screens to identify whether the user was a patient or a caregiver and to understand their specific needs. Program overview screens presented concise summaries of recommended patient support programs, while guided question pages further personalised the experience to ensure accurate recommendations. A dedicated sign-up flow allowed users to enrol in programs directly through the platform.
                </p>

                <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were subsequently developed into high-fidelity, interactive Figma prototypes, which were used for testing and iterative review with the team at Elemetric Health.</p>

                <p>Given the healthcare context, a key design priority was ensuring the platform was highly usable and easy to understand, reducing the risk of confusion or user error. The design was guided by established UX and interaction principles, including Nielsen’s usability heuristics. In particular, the application of visibility of system status, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, and recognition rather than recall ensured the platform was intuitive, accurate, and relevant for both patients and caregivers.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>
                This project deepened my understanding of designing for sensitive, high-impact healthcare contexts where accessibility and personalization are critical. I learned how to translate complex information into intuitive flows, balance user needs across diverse audiences, and ensure that digital tools provide meaningful, practical support.
