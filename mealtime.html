                I analysed competitor products to understand the problems users face with available products and noted what is prolonging or complicating the experience. I also collected user reviews and noted what features users like and dislike to better understand their needs and priorities.

                    Through the competitor audit, the important elements that would help improve the grocery shopping and meal prepping experience and the user priorities were clear. ​​​​​​​In order to better focus on increasing accessibility of the app, I also evaluated current navigation and shopping apps and features that are specifically designed for disabled people.
                </p>

                <p>In order to visualise where those features can be implemented in the user journey, I produced user flows. This detailed the actions the users would take to view and add items to their grocery list and navigate the store. </p>

                Sketch wireframes aim: Include features that helps users efficiently add to and manage their grocery lists whilst fitting to their dietary requirements and budgets.

                <p>
                Features such as, quick add (+) lists, budget and dietary requirement filters and grocery recommendations based on meal plans means that users can quickly add to their grocery lists and shop without a worry. For persons with disabilities, providing filters so that information only from stores that provide safe ways for them to navigate them is helpful and saves them time.

                I explored ways that the app could present an easier and faster way to get relevant details. This meant better overviews, quick summaries, efficient management of planned meals and prep times, ability to find and build communities and receiving help to navigate in stores and get groceries.

                <p>
                    Based on the feedback, users felt that certain features such as a following list was not as relevant in their user journey and felt that there were other features that could be more useful in order to help them navigate stores and find meals. 
                </p>

                <P>
                    Interactive elements such as a checklist was important for users to visualise their progress during grocery shopping so that they could easily tell what items they still had to find.
                </P>

                <p>
                    Audio confirmation of objects was also important for blind users to confirm their items before adding it to their baskets.
                </p>
            
                <P>
                    Furthermore, users also felt that there can be features that help them identify what they have already purchased and is about to expire so that they can stay organised and reduce food waste.

                <p>
                    As the feedback included proposed features that were missing or suggestions about certain features not being useful, I made changes such as adding a notifications page that shared an overview of the updates within the users network and visual details such as an interactive checklist and bright red text to highlight what was almost expiring. These features helped improve the user experience as it made important details more visible and helped users keep better track of their purchases.

                <p>
                    This project strengthened my ability to design holistic systems that support everyday behaviours and routines. I learned how to balance usability with long-term habit-building, simplify complex tasks, and create interfaces that reduce cognitive load. Most importantly, I gained experience designing practical solutions that genuinely improve convenience and wellbeing in users’ daily lives.
